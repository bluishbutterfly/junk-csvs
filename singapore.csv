Woke up today and felt it gotten worse (worst sore throat in my life). While making my honey lemon at 7am in the morning today, I tested using ART and tested positive for COVID. Second time this year. Last week (Mon I think) we were visited by friends who tested positive a day after. They were living in a house who got positive days before coming to our house. So yeh, it’s still happening."

11,"/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for October 16, 2022","(old) reddit mobile is annoyingly popping up the nag overlay every few pages to ask me to use their app. Used to happen just once and doesn't appear again after it's dismissed for a relatively long time.  I'm using old reddit mobile because it has features the app and other apps don't have, and also don't have the anti-features on the app. Not saying what they are, because knowing these evil developers, once they find out, they'll probably nerf it.  Edit: found an ad-free android app (redreader) that has a feature I want. It cannot open tabs (like in a browser) to suit my current workflow but that's a chance I'll accept to escape that annoying pop up."

49,Singapore’s ‘affordable public housing’ leaves citizens feeling priced out,"In sg,the problems started when minister in-charge changed policy from build based on projected demand to BTO model.HE is the culprit who created the mess we are in.all because he had some flats that did not sell.This has been one of the biggest failures of our government.covid didn't help because everything almost came to a halt and we didnt have any homes because there was already 2-3 year wait at that time.now it has stretched to 5 years.which leads to pressure on resale market and prices are going up and up with no end in sight.sad state of affairs when one person's shortsightedness leads to suffering for so many."

51,Singapore’s ‘affordable public housing’ leaves citizens feeling priced out,"As we can't feasibly build more BTOs forever due to limited land, the bigger trouble seems to be a hidden inter-generation divide. The older generation does not want to lose money on their HDB ""investment"" while the younger generation needs affordable resale flats or old land to be freed for more BTOs. The obvious solution is to cap resale prices on public housing and enforce 99 year lease, but I'm sure not even WP wants to take the political damage."

61,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,I wanted to be a soldier when I was 10 😂 then I grew up
62,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,It’s called the Singaporean dream because you have to be asleep to believe it
63,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,We had a dream?
64,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,Is the __________ dream crumbling?  My man this is literally what everyone dealing with in any country. Not even unique to Singaporean.
65,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"I think you need to realize that life is meaningless and what you get at the end of the day is all there is. A thousand years from now when mankind has driven itself into extinction, none of this would have ever mattered. Having said that, do what you can and enjoy the moment, it’s all you have."
66,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"I dont see why we have to aim so high. It normally results in disappointment. Those shoes are too big. There is nothing wrong with living a plain, unassuming but happy life.   After all it is laughable to think everybody can be one of those jobs. Service, f&b etc are all essential to the society. Simply, the dream of the individual is not quite the same as the dream of the collective."
67,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"I dont know why young Singaporeans want to torture yourself with a fantasy that Singapore was once full of hope and opportunities but the rug was pulled from them only in this generation.  Most boomers grew up poor and their parents didnt legally own property. Literally not starving and homeless was the dream already. My parents got their flat in their 40s and my inlaws got theirs in their 30s, after their 3rd child was born.  In my time in the 90s, the HDB queue was 7 years long. Couples discuss HDB while schooling.  There was a brief period when HDB queue got short but it was an otherwise horrible time because of the recession and SARS, so much so the government built casinos in sheer panic.  But somehow Singapore is worse off now? Its pure fantasy for people with rose tinted view of history."
68,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"In the past, Singapore identity and association was predominantly local. There is now a distinct change - Caucasians, PRC, India Indians, Vietnamese, Filipinos etc in schools, workplace and neighbourhoods.  Because our immigration policy targets better qualified and more wealthy foreigners for PR and citizenship, the dream now is not to be the underclass in one's own country.  In time, Singapore likely revert back to the point where Singapore was treated as a convenient and attractive trading post and emporium of the East and open to all as during the colonial era. New ethnic enclaves are forming not in terms of geography but in terms of interaction and association. So you hear of South Africans whites having a social gathering, Americans, the French, the Thai, the Indians etc. not out of malice or parochialism but due to familiarity and a sense of belonging.  I came across a YouTube clips that focussed on Blacks both African and American who have moved to Singapore for work. A series of light hearted interviews. Most of views were how great a place to work and live but less complimentary of locals. Its was truly sad. Both the interviewer and interviewees were blacks but probably forgot that it will end up in social media for all to see. They genuinely thought they were helping Singapore and the locals. Other foreign communities residing here have the same sense but are more cautious of what they say for public consumption.  So a local Singaporean will not find it meaningless but anxious that he or she is not left behind in his own country and will probably work harder to hold his or her place.  I suppose a price has to be paid for being economically successful. The key question is is it worth it."
69,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,The dream is not to collect cardboard for exercise
70,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"Cows don’t need to dream, cows just need to produce milk. In the same way Singaporeans just need to provide labour and taxes."
71,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,This is not just specific to SG. All kids dream and wake up to reality in the end
72,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,Erm about 80% of the world's so called dream will be paying bills. Only the 20% will really achieve their dreams. It's called reality.
73,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"We work to pay the bills and have a roof over our head. We only look forward to our block leave so we can travel/slack to temporary numb the pain... And then it's back to work again before you know it. By the time we retire, hopefully we'd have invested/saved enough to do what we want (Providing we're still healthy enough to do so.)"
74,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,when is your written essay due?
75,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,Somehow feeling thankful to support a real estate cleptocracy by dwelling in a brutalist block of housing in exchange for $1M+ is no dream. It is a nightmare that people can't seem to wake up from.
76,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,>Some of us said we wanted to test the norm and be a astronaut or even a superhero others conventionally said doctors or even scientist.   plenty of doctors and scientists out there. if anything the size of the medical school cohort and uni cohort in general has continually been increasing. singaporeans have more opportunities to achieve those dreams than ever before.
77,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,What is the *Singaporean Dream*?  >Some of us said we wanted to test the norm and be a astronaut or even a superhero others conventionally said doctors or even scientist  Isn't this the norm of any child? What makes it uniquely Singaporean?
78,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"Astronaut? Doctor? Scientist? Bruh, do you even know how much effort and sacrifice it takes to be any of these? There's dreams and then there's just being unrealistic...."
79,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"Since when do we have a dream? All along, it has been our government’s agenda to supercharge our material needs in a country that is run like a corporation. Social and material debts are then accumulated and passed on generations after generations."
80,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"err... isn't it the same every where else?  there'll always be dreams, its up to you to reach that dream..  there are enclaves everywhere you go. if it's not by race, it'll be by religion.."
81,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,Good reflection
82,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,ngl I read your opening sentence here and stopped reading lol
83,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"Let me chip in with some of my perspectives garnered from experience. The disappointment is more of a situation we find ourselves in as a generation rather than as a Singaporean, French, Indian or whatever. Those dreams were reformatted by a global order that maximized their wealth and opportunities by squeezing out the middle class and poor. Look at how the wealthy are able to grow their wealth (and pass it on) through tax loopholes, tax reductions, bailouts, etc while the middle class aren’t even guaranteed their pensions or a decent lifestyle once their stop working (which keeps moving forward in the late 60s).  But doom and gloom aside, as much as I am critical of government policies on many fronts, average Singaporeans should experience life in other countries and see how much better they have it. World class infrastructure, good quality healthcare, subsidized education, opportunities to tap in to higher education overseas, “affordable” public housing, etc. these give them a much better shot at the “dream” than most of the middle-class in the world. Sure, it may not be fair - but life seldom is.   The insidious strategy the wealthy and powerful employ is to make the less well off think that their disappointments are because of the others - based on their nationality, and in other countries ethnicities. When in fact, it’s all because wealth (or those who cover it) has a parasitic relation with society overall."
84,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,You guys have dreams?
85,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,They're called dreams because you have to be asleep to believe it
86,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,In any society some will be able to live above their means some just enough some will not. Our whole life is all about where you at in the bell curve
87,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"Just earn enough to keep yourself alive, go for an occasion holiday to escape."
88,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,at least we we are still in an environment where the dream is still possible and not totally dead
89,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,Money. Money will keep the dream alive.
90,Is the Singaporean dream crumbling?,"The story I heard was that if one graduates with a degree decades ago, maybe in the 1980-90s, he can easily find a job and then settle down easily. Cost of living was decent, MRTs were less congested, no internet and life was simpler then.  Then it became if one throws a stone in a busy street nowadays, it will hit a degree holder lol. Now degree holders are common everywhere and there are more competition from overseas.   No doubt it's harder to live in these times but we are still doing better than many countries? We live in a relatively stable and safe environment here (just look at the news in Indonesia and Thailand recently).  I attended a night class for a course few years ago and the lecturer was saying, comparing to unemployment around the world, one can still find a job here. (The pay range and interest aside of course) Maybe we have to adjust our expectations, count our blessings and live with more contentment in the current era."

110,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I usually stare down the vehicle till it stops before putting a foot on the zebra crossing.

113,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I’ve been on a zebra crossing with my 2.5 year old (holding hands), we checked before crossing, there was a boom gate about 20m up the driveway, a car was there, somehow they came within inches of us in their haste to drive on. We have repeatedly had cars note our presence on the footpath waiting to cross at a zebra crossing and they just keep driving as if we are invisible (despite having looked right at us). I find it so strange."
114,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),drivers be like: what u mean I can't just run pedestrians over? I paid 100k for a certificate that entitled me to do what I want!

116,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),This post needs more upvotes. Frankly accelerating at zebra crossing should be more heavily fined and have longer jail term.
117,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Root cause is that people really have no chill. Everyone's in such a fucking hurry as if their lives depended on saving every last second.
118,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I agree. As a driver you must always have the duty of care, whether you are in the right or wrong. Flesh vs metal, metal will always win.   Pedestrian/PMD crossing when the pedestrian crossing is red? Stop and wait. Stretch your neck out and look back to check at the pedestrian crossing especially turning right at a discretionary right turn.  Zebra crossing coming up? Slow down to check if cyclist/PMD is planning to rush at the crossing without care. Go extra slow especially at high foliage/dark zebra crossing areas.   Speaking as a driver. Remember, **flesh vs metal, metal will always win.**"
119,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I've lived here a decade, had my license and owned a simple little car for about 3 years.   Having been driving for the past 20 years overseases, this is my observation:  - On the road courtesy is very poor.  As in letting people merge, etc.  Worst offenders are BMW, Audi, Merc owners generally.  I don't know if it's ego or what, but everyone thinks they're in a race and God forbid you should let someone ahead of you.  - ped crossings I'm always very careful and slow down, this is just instinct.  I have def seen people run these as you stated, it's happened to me plenty of times  - defensive driving is a must.  Have to constantly keep an eye on everyone, see point 1.  - cyclists and grab riders need to keep a close eye on.  I support their sport/work for sure, but there's some really selfish and reckless behavior by some over the past couple years  - full moon makes things way worse.  Sounds nuts i know, but the driving gets worse almost every time.    Is it worth driving?  Well, for me yes, cuts my commute in half or better, and with kids it's a big help, and got the car ""cheap"" by SG standards.   But by god, can it be stressful sometimes compared to other countries I've driven in.  Be careful out there, and do know that some of us motorists are definitely keeping an eye out for your safety!"
120,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Driving culture is simply a reflection of singaporean psyche
121,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I had a driver accelerate at me when I was crossing (signalised, green man, but it was one of those ""cars can turn while pedestrians are crossing"" junctions) once. Pretty scary. He seemed very apologetic so I guess it was some sort of brain fart, but just one more second of that could have injured me badly.   Our driving culture may be part of it, but I think our infrastructure design is also worth re-evaluating."
122,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Super aggressive tailgating, speeding, failing to indicate, deliberately obstructing others trying to change lanes, drunk driving … Singapore roads are like Mad Max and it’s the lack of a visible police presence and little or no random breath testing."
123,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Driving culture here is ridiculous. Been driving for 10+ years and I always practice defensive driving.   Many times I kept to the left lane on expressways at least 1 exit before my intended exit. You will see idiots cutting all 4 lanes, jam brake in front of me, and exit crossing the chevron markings.   Whenever I brake quite hard, my left hand automatically goes to the hazard lights so the cars behind me know I'm braking hard.  Seriously!   (Zero demerit points since i got my license 15 years ago). Yes I'm old."

125,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),SAF drivers are also decent drivers.  We follow all road rules to the T. We give way to pedestrians. We stop at stop lines.
126,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),laughs in Taiwanese.   Cars here literally don’t give a fuck about crossings and will just drive through crowds.
127,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Saw this and I have to comment. Just few days ago I was at Takashimaya. Dropped off the bus stop and head over through the car drop off area. I saw the signage with ""use pedestrian crossing"" so as a law abiding citizen I did.  I crossed the zebra crossing and low and behold, not 1 but 2 cars started to dash across the zebra crossing. I have already started crossing, means my feet was already on the road, and with my ankle recently sprained, I can only keep a slow speed. Car 1 accerated pretty fast but realised he cannot pass through in time, so he pulled an emergency stop. Car 2, continued dashing as I was making my way. I can feel the car just charging right at me and the driver only realised when I was a few steps away from the other sids kerb. He proceeds to slam the brakes causing him and the passenger to jut forwards, car bumper just inches away from me.   Thankfully Im a uni student who is already dead inside so I wasnt much perturbed, just gave him a hand sign that gestures ""wtf are u doing"". He waved apologetically and i went my jolly way. Good grief these madman rushing for reincarnation."

130,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Nowadays we really can't rely on car being reliable to stop when it should. I usually make sure I'm not on the road unless the car has stopped or looks like decelerating..  I won't put my life at risk like that. Worst case the car don't stop I just need to wait for the next chance.
131,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Wait for the car to stop before crossing, it's your life on the line. Yes they **should** stop for you but what if they don't? Charge them in court in the afterlife?"
132,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Watching urban design vids from channels like Not Just Bikes has awakened me to how car-friendly our street designs are for a country that ostensibly needs to limit car growth. These incidents happen all around the world, not because any particular nationality is trash at driving or has uniquely terrible attitudes on the roads, but because our road design is catered more towards speed rather than safety.   [This recent video](https://youtu.be/_ByEBjf9ktY) from Not Just Bikes on pedestrian crossings make the argument that we must design our roads such that drivers must pay attention. We should be raising all street crossings to pedestrian levels, thus creating humps at intersections and forcing drivers to slow down. We could probably make streets a bit more windy and controlling speeds as a result. And of course expand on public transit and bike lanes to reduce the need for private transport.   Still in the meantime, I lean more towards a  fuckcars  mentality where those operating those  metal horses have been given too much societal leeway and need to have the book thrown at them"
133,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"It's not just on the roads, it happens on the streets and footpaths as well. People rushing here and there, easily frustrated and stressed out, wanting/needing to reach their destinations asap, as if a few minutes of delay will cost them their entire lives.   It's interesting how we already live in such a compact and efficient country where places are located close to each other, unlike those bigger countries where people travel from state to state and spend hours on commuting each day with even more delays in between, but people still keep expecting everything to be done faster and faster. Having too much of good things makes people even more spoilt and entitled, setting higher expectations instead of slowing down a little to appreciate life and having a bit more patience in doing things."
134,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),They need to put traffic lights instead of zebra crossing for some areas because of this.
135,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I was just walking across the zebra crossing this morning holding my grandmother’s hand, probably 3/4 of the way and a guy zoomed around the corner and sped through the crossing in front of us   Couple of times this has happened to me, but the scariest was crossing almost to the middle of the zebra crossing and a car beating the red light and speeding right past me, so near i felt i could touch it.   I don’t understand how hard it is waiting that 5 mins more rather than possibly killing someone"
136,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"There are some good drivers and some seriously shit ones. Just as there are pedestrians who are aware of their surrounds and those who walk with blinders on. No sense in throwing shade on any particular group.

137,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Driving in sg is awful. So stressful for pedestrians
138,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Maybe people may take my comment the wrong way, but I always pay attention and watch out at pedestrian crossings like lights and especially zebra crossings. I rather be slow and alive, than to insist on my rights and be dead. Placing my faith in other human beings doing the right thing is laughable nowadays with the number of asshats around."
139,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Sg drivers are honestly the worst. I once saw this driver honk at a cyclist at a green man!!  Wtf was he trying to do? Drive across a green man? Lol. It was a red light for him.   And i nearly got ran down before by a vehicle that accelerated while turning on a green man. Idiot wanted to brake but pushed the accelerator instead
140,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"C'mon, they paid 100k dollars to have the RIGHT to drive and murder people in the road. Have some sympathy!!   #/s"
141,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),I agree. Pls stay safe. Always look right left right before crossing!! 🙏
142,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"As much as I agree with your sentiment, more enforcement is almost never the real solution. One of the best ways to shift driving behaviour is through road design.  All those zebra crossings? Raise them to the pavement level, and see how many cars are still willing to fly over a speed bump.  All the speeding left turning cars? Make the turning radius much smaller (ie. make it a sharp corner) and see how many drivers are willing to fly over a curb.  Road design in Singapore is too forgiving to drivers, hence we see excessive carelessness."
143,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I never trust sg drivers to stop at zebra crossings and for them to stop at the white line before turning into a major road, because chances are, they don’t. Their mindset is usually, maybe I can just accelerate abit and squeeze through before anyone comes, and save 1min off their miserable life. And then probably the same people blame our society for being fast paced, pragmatic and lack of compassion.  When I go overseas however, in Europe and US, drivers will stop for you even if they have the right of way because somehow, they have the graciousness and common sense to know that they are driving a 1 tonne metallic monster vs your human flesh and bones.  Tldr: if you value your life in sg, always have eye contact with the drivers to make sure they ack and stop before crossing even if you have the right of way, and probably put up your hand as well."
144,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Recently I almost got run over by a vehicle running the red light... through a crowded crossing. What's wrong with people.
145,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Raised crossings and zebra crossings will probably be the solution, forcing the driver to slow down, and if they speed up, their front bumper can say good bye"
146,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Sometimes they’ll purposely accelerate, look the other way to check for oncoming traffic and raise their other hand to tell you to “excuse” them. As they speed right in front of you"
147,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I’ve been saying this again and again: left turn slip roads (ie zebra crossings) have no place on roads around residential estates or places with having foot traffic. Even in car haven USA, such implementations are rare in cities and can only be at highway on ramps and off ramps, which makes sense given the speed of the traffic. But why does LTA/URA think it’s good to allow traffic to turn at high speeds next to schools and markets?  LTA is a victim of its own success. It knows how to make road traffic flow at high speeds across the city, and has done it very well. But this is at the expense of everyone else not in a car.   The one that should be getting the blame is LTA for allowing such conflicts to happen with the left turn slip roads."
148,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"The problem is when you see a car going at one speed so you time crossing the street in your brain(“ok I have 7 seconds to get across”) and then they accelerate - so if you look the other way , it’s possible to get hit by them .. so moral of the story is look both ways constantly every time crossing the street"

150,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Rented a place in katong for 2 years and I never had so many close encounters with being ran down by a vehicle compared to many other period of my life. So many drivers especially in affluent areas treated driving a car as a given and it shows.  This post reminded me of a time where I was doing groceries at marine parade, an elderly woman (70+) was crossing the road with her market trolley and I could see the driver screaming and throwing hand gestures at her through the car window... chill la bro.."
151,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),The funniest part of this post is that you think bus drivers are the best on the road lol. In general I would say they have yet to master proper use of the brakes. I don't know how many times I have saw elderly people almost falling over on buses due to overly aggressive braking
152,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),I should be careful because of traffic across zebra crossings. I should raise the hand to stop vehicles while I'm using zebra crossing.
153,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Usually at zebra crossing I will let the car go first, unless they stopped fully and intention is clear to let me cross first. For traffic light I would also wait for the cars to stop before crossing. Have met a car who zoomed past a red light once, was glad that I am a slow walker lol.   There is a crossing near my house where both pedestrians and buses have right of way on the same lane and I can't tell you how dangerously close the buses sometimes are to brushing against me while I am still crossing. Can only say is poor road design and not really the bus driver's fault."

155,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Never auto-assume sinkie drivers will stop for you at pedestrian crossings. Always make sure they are stopping before you cross. Sinkie drivers are pretty fucked up in general.
156,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Yes.. the amount of time when it’s green man and ppl not wanting to let me cross even though I am about to step out… they rush to “Turn Left” even though it’s the green man and my right of way… happens so many times. Or even at zebra crossing, the cars rushing and won’t slow down or stop. Singapore really got the worst driving culture I have seen in a few cities… I wish they would be tighter on drivers who doesn’t give way to pedestrians when it’s their right of way."
157,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"It's a kiasu mentality, nothing new. Unless each of us changes ourselves first, we won't can't even match up with 3rf world societies. Singaporeans by large are kiasu, kiasi. Nothing will change till more punishments and nanny-governing comes in."
158,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),LTA looks after the efficiency of our roadways. But who looks after the safety and adequacy of our pedestrian amenities?
159,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Public bus drivers are not that safe. They speed and jam their brakes aggressively. They’re probably under duress to reach their next stop on time. I’m a parent who has to take the bus with a pram, and can’t tell you the number of times they stop so far away from the curb I have to physically carry the pram on or off the bus because the pram can’t reach it."
160,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"A recent encounter of mine, I was about to cross at a zebra crossing of a slip road turning left, and a driver who refused to slow down sped past while giving the middle finger. I truly dont understand."
161,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Gonna just add to what others have said - when crossing a road at a traffic junction and a zebra crossing, make sure that they stop then you start crossing, and stare at the driver for the entire time that you are crossing."
162,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Not every bus driver is careful though, some are just as reckless. However I would imagine their penalty is higher if they get into an accident."
163,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Idk whether is it appropriate or whether does it relate to the topic or not but my friend's mom gave birth to my friend's sibling a few months too early bc of an incident kinda like urs and the baby ended up in the nicu and then passed away a few days later because she got sick then she passed away. This whole bad driving culture thing is just sad at this point. Edit: my mom's friend made sure there was no cars in her surroundings but a car suddenly cheong infront of her when she almost made it to the end:(
164,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),A lot of it can be put down to privilege and entitlement.
165,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Pedestrians don’t always have the right of way in SG. I looked up the law bc I was always getting mowed down by cars, even when I was heavily pregnant. ETA: I think maybe this is why drivers don’t care about pedestrians. In other countries, pedestrians always have the right of way no matter if they are at a crossing or not."
166,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),The worst is when they won’t stop for pedestrians at a zebra crossing when it’s raining. They are sitting in the cars nice and dry while the pedestrian is walking in a monsoon and they can’t stop for them?? Why? 😩

168,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Here is my hot take to resolve this issue:  We need to start showing drivers that a car is not something entitled to themselves, I say we rename the dang ""COE""  as it gives the wrong message to those with 6 digits in their bank account. We should rename it to ""Certificate of ownership of machinery of death/Personal  Environment Destroyer"" or something"
169,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Lots of SG folk don't appreciate the fact that outside of developed countries, drivers don't give two hoots about zebra and pedestrian crossings. They get lulled into this false sense of security here and rant when such incidents happen 1 out of the 20 crossings they make. Law gives you right of way but that can't give your life back when a driver is an idiot. As others may have suggested, put away devices, walk your bikes(ask even the most careful drivers how often a silly bike or PMD decides to dash across just cos green man blinking with 5 secs left) and look at directions where vehicles can come from. If the place is a hotspot for such incidents, record an instance and make your MP work by asking for a regulated turn signal."
170,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"More a reflection of high density and high paced life in Singapore. Can even see the difference between outer neighbourhoods and closer to the city. Nothing to do with culture. In NY we have to be cautious the moment we step out. you go to Silicon Valley, buildings are few and far between so the opposite effect."
171,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Light about to turn red = means the light is amber. When a car is too near an amber light to brake in time, the correct thing to do is speed up. If the car brakes too suddenly, it puts the car behind at risk."
172,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),">What kind of a depraved mindset do you need to have to accelerate at a pedestrian waiting to cross at a zebra crossing or at a traffic light about to turn red? Why is the driving culture in Singapore so bad?  Probably the sort of ""I must win/show/dominate them"" coupled with the general sense of entitlement that comes with a COE.  It's the philosophy. I half recall this guy on CNA saying something along the lines of he doesn't really know why he does these things - it's a feeling of you just gotta win or something, so he just does.  As one of those despicable individuals who bike commute, I have taken to the philosophy of ""Everybody gets to f\*\*k off."" If everybody gets to f\*\*\* off, as far as I'm concerned, everybody wins.  It can still be difficult with some drivers - I have given way or slowed down for cars turning out at a junction only for the driver to pull over at said junction and look at his phone. Of course, they then will want to move when I do (and they wouldn't have seen me either).  If you haven't seen [this](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/drivers-feel-it-is-safe-for-them-to-use-their-phones-while-driving-but-not-safe-for-others) old ST article, you probably should. I only remember it because the caption for me perfectly describes the typical Singapore driver mentality. *""Some 83 per cent of the drivers feel it is safe to use their mobile phones while driving and  admitted to doing so in the last year, a survey by Samsung found. More than 90 per cent of drivers however said they found it dangerous for other drivers to use their mobile phones while driving.""*"

175,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Started experiencing more of this behaviour starting few years back. Drivers do not give a shit and it becomes a daring contest between pedestrians and them. Literally have to stare down at the car to make known my intention to cross the zebra crossing when I’m one step away from the crossing. Where the fuck has basic courtesy gone to?
176,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I’m from the UK and tbh, it’s crazy to me how the light turns green in SG while pedestrians are crossing and cars can turn in. Cars typically wait for pedestrians to cross but wtf is the point of a green light if pedestrians are crossing."
177,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),pedestrian need exercise caution while walking and not like keep on look at phone when walking or plug in earbuds. driver must also look out for the zebra crossing and prepare to stop. both side must be alert.
178,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),I just cross while looking at the driver. It's like giving em a staredown and showing you're not afraid. Driver would be at fault anyways if I was hit
179,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Preach. So inconsiderate of the drivers to do this, like you're already driving, just how much in a hurry you are that you can't slow down a little to let someone walking pass go first?"
180,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Yeah a lot of people are rushing and doesn't care for others. Once I saw 4 cars rush through the zebra crossing before a decent driver stopped for me lol.
181,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"There was this one time that I got honked at for what I suspected to be me walking too slowly, even though:  - the pedestrian crossing light still has 10 more seconds to it - I was carrying a ton of stuff"
182,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Singapore needs draconian laws like we have for drugs.u drink and drive,1st offence 3 months suspension 2nd 6 months 3rd 12months and after that revoke.aforementioned with heavy fines.cameras on traffic lights are not practical but car cams are everywhere so use them!let drivers report other drivers who are driving dangerously. Being able to drive is a privilege and it comes with responsibilities.if you cant handle it than get off the road."
183,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Having lived in SG for a bit over 10 years, unfortunately I have to say SG drivers are some of the most selfish I have seen anywhere in the world.  Almost every day as a pedestrian, I see red light running. Cars not stopping at traffic lights. Cars changing lanes without indicating. Not letting other vehicles merge. Illegal u-turns almost causing collisions. Some of this could be to just poorly skilled drivers, but a lot of it is deliberate. And let's not even start talking about the entitled drivers who think they should not have to share the roads with cyclists.  The Traffic Police need to get more proactive. How often do you even see a TP vehicle around? Proactively patrolling and ticketing drivers for things like this would be a small step in the right direction. At the moment 90% of of it reactive only."
184,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),I am not a driver but as a avid pedestrian(lol) cyclist are waaaaay worst  Cyclist are mostly scum bags of the road who thinks they are King and invincible

186,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"You meet your fair share of bad drivers but as drivers we also meet our fair share of self entitled pedestrian. Granted the fact so matter whose fault will it be, blame is always at the driver and victim is mostly the pedestrian. However bear in mind that at times there are also many folks who take things for granted. Cross the road without looking, dash across road etc. Driver at times are also blinded by the t-bone. Being both a pedestrian and driver, it helps you see a better perspective using both lens."
187,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),">Even though I could afford to drive, and I have a driving license, I would never want to. The stress having to deal with the driving culture here on the roads everyday is not worth it  I've lived in and been to quite a few countries, and Singapore is genuinely one of the few where I'm actually scared to drive because of whole 'me first fuck you' driving culture. I'd honestly even be more comfortable driving in countries like India, because even though it's a mess there's still at least a flow to the traffic whereas from what I've seen here drivers tend to be a lot more unpredictable and *generally* more aggressive.  As a pedestrian the things that *really* fuck me off, though, are at the crossings across slip lanes when drivers don't indicate (or indicate *the wrong way* \- how people who regularly do that are able to pass a driving test is beyond me) and then stop right on top of the pedestrian crossing. I genuinely can't imagine being so inconsiderate that I'd stop my car right on top of the crossing."
188,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Drivers who accelerates at yellow lights into cross junctions in attempt to beat it.  Drivers who is doing 50kmph just to emergency brake 1m before a junction to turn into it. No blinkers too wtf.

191,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I have driven in Taiwan, Aust, Manila, msia, SG, Usa (CA).  I personally feel SG drivers rank amonst the best in my exp.  Aust is a unique case because where I went the pop density is low."
192,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Singaporean pedestrians aren't any better. I always see people just put their life at risk just to go somewhere faster, crossing the street because the road is empty.  Cars are dangerous and people don't respect the danger. It's messed up on both sides. The only difference is who is gonna live after the accident.  If we have to change, we need to change the mindset of drivers and pedastrians.  Stricter laws lead us to America, looser laws gives us Philippines. Rather, I personally think we should promote anti-complacency behaviours. Encouraging being mindful that we could run over/be runned over would be a start to safer roads."
193,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"The same thing needs to be said about pedestrians who leisurely cross the road, chatting away or using their phones when the lights have already changed. The rules apply in all ways.i especially observe this with white English people."

195,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),It is not uncommon that a car takes left turn and stops at pedestrian crossing. Not sure how these drivers get license.
196,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Made a post regarding this and came those fuckers commenting “HoW arE You gonNa croSS roads in Malaysia???”
197,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Sometimes I feel jaywalking is safer than using the zebra crossing or even the traffic lights here. At least jaywalking u are actively looking out.  So many cases of ppl taking these pedestrian crossings for granted - playing with their phones, not checking before crossing and just assume cuz it's green or there's a sign means they got some kinda invincible bubble.  Always good to pay attention even if u think u have the right of way. Car suffer scratches n at most go workshop, but you may end up in hospital or even worse, ded."
198,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"in our current culture the best way to handle this is to name and shame via video capture. once shitty drivers are aware that they are prone to infamy if bad driving persists, hopefully the kiasi culture will pave the way towards safer roads.  &#x200B;  stomp the shitty road users sinkies!"
199,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),> I estimate that about 20-30% of drivers do this based on all my pedestrian years here living in SG.

200,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),just be more alert for own safety. u are responsible for your own safety.
201,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"When waiting to cross any zebra crossing, it's always best to wait until the vehicles stop before crossing the road.  My personal trick to annoy them is to stare them done through their windshield until they stop. On the 3 occasions when they still didn't stop via staring, I feinted to dash across the road to make them e-brake. Worked so far."
202,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Besides more enforcement - MHA really needs to get divisional police officers to catch these types of traffic offences, next time just hold your phone us as if recording. That seems to do the trick 😈"

The Chinese-Singaporean taxi driver floored it to get them to scatter, as he showed disgust . blew me away."
206,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Word. It’s even worse s a cyclist. I’ve literally had drivers yelling at me to get off the road, as though their COE means that cyclists must get out of their way. Most pass me in the same lane without moving at all. I wonder, if I was their parent or child, would they behave the same way?"
207,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Next time please note the car number down. Then complain to traffic police on the net by submitting an online report. If you can take a pic at least or even better a video , the police takes you seriously. Even if you dont, just submit the report, sometimes they look for footage from nearby cctv feeds."

209,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I almost got hit by a car a few days ago as well.  Was crossing the entrance of my gf’s condo, and saw this car at the main road waiting to turn in.  I made eye contact with the car, it was stationery so I crossed the crossing. After a few steps, car actually accelerated towards me. Almost hit my back by a few feet.  Raised my arm and gestured to driver who was a 50-60 year old uncle, had his wife(?) next to him too.  He actually winded down the window and we got into a shouting match. He asked me why I didn’t look carefully, I rebutted by saying why he still inched forward from a stationery stop when eye contact was made, he diam diam. Then the security guard came, and fker took the chance to drive off.  I had close calls with cars before but this fker actually told me it was my fault??  Went to make a police report after that, I just hope he already has pre existing demerit points and hopefully he gets his license revoked though unlikely."
210,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),I kick the car if it goes past me at a zebra
211,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I have the opposite experience with difficult pedestrians. Also generalising, but living in a heartlands area I have auntie and uncles jaywalking in the middle of the night, literally anywhere. Sometimes they take the 'pedestrian has the right of way' too far and don't even look up at the road and start crossing, expecting you to stop for them. I have slammed the brakes more than once and even once got hit in the back by the sudden jam break from a crusing speed.   Think everyone needs to respect the roads more in sg.   ... not that we are doing that horribly, because the roads in other SEA countries are 19x worse than Singapore."
212,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Lol what I usually do take up my phone and start recording, if they dare to come down then I will dare to beat the shit out of them.  Anyway they never did, why? Cuz most of the SG guy are spineless only Kurt Tay dare to take on a sparring match."
213,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Personally I feel like a lot of pedestrians be entitled to think that all vehicles need to stop for them at all times.  Sometimes we really don’t see pedestrians because either they are not in view or we don’t expect them to cross.  I as a pedestrian also, care about my life whilst crossing roads so I do what most ppl in the comments do. Wait till a car has completely stopped before crossing. Personally I feel like this is common sense because nobody owes your life anything other Thn yourself"
214,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Its not a singapore thing, the driver behaviour is the same in almost every major city."
215,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Sorry but if you show any weakness at all, I am going to get ahead of you rather than wait the 3 minutes for you to cross."
216,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),That's why I hate driving in SG though i have a car. I rather be driven. Gives me so much stress. I enjoy driving overseas though.
217,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"> What kind of a depraved mindset do you need to have to *accelerate* at a pedestrian waiting to cross at a zebra crossing or at a traffic light about to turn red?  Impatience for the former, but literally driving school doctrine for the latter. I was taught to slow down before a traffic light but to accelerate again once the lights are clearly in my favour (even yellow) to avoid emergency braking when it actually turns red.   > Before anyone accuses me of generalization, I would like to tell you that that is *exactly* what I'm doing. I estimate that about 20-30% of drivers do this based on all my pedestrian years here living in SG.  Wow, 20-30% is sufficient to generalize. If 20-30% of angmohs I see here are jerks, can  I then conclude that all angmohs are jerks?  > The only group of drivers that I can say are decent on the roads here are public bus drivers.   Have you taken enough buses, or paid enough attention when taking them? Or is it that 20-30% of bus drivers are decent, therefore the whole lot is decent?"
218,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"If ""20-30% of drivers do this"" and ""The only group of drivers that I can say are decent on the roads here are public bus drivers"", so public bus drivers constitute 70-80% of drivers?"

220,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),">The stress having to deal with the driving culture here on the roads everyday is not worth it. Among other negatives.  um, are you ok? seems like things aren't going so well for you at the moment."
221,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Zebra crossing only (with no traffic light) is cross at your own risk. I got a reply from LTA.

222,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),They should start placing cameras at zebra crossings
223,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"every single school day morning, there's this one nyps parent who turns their car out of the side road before the lutheran twrs bus stop, straight into the path of the 174 or 961, forcing the bus to jam brake. very retarded"
224,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Holy shit, I’ve never seen this before. Can I ask where in Singapore do you live?"
225,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Holy shoots … I too got nearly mowed down by a mafaking auntie in a Mercs.
226,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Pedestrians being scared of drivers at zebra crossings is why I always slow to a crawl long before the crossing if there is someone there, and stop way before the line if there's children or they're the kind to wait for drivers to stop first. Saves us both a few seconds in the end and we both feel much safer."
227,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I've been here for over a decade and it's definitely been getting worse, though Singapore drivers are still miles better than the ones in some other countries.  I just posted the other day that I got knocked down at a crossing myself - though I think that was more due to the driver watching a different pedestrian and assuming the road was clear, rather than aggressive driving.  What kinda bugs me is the discretionary right turns.  Sometimes you see drivers turn on the green man and force crossing pedestrians to slow down or even stop in the middle of the road."
228,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Im glad that the discretionary right turns are finally going away. As a driver, its always a situation of confusion on whether to go or wait. As a pedestrian, there is always the fear of a car turning too early and not checking for pedestrians. A simple red arrow light can really go a long way in making our roads safer"
229,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Sadly this is now becoming more common. Time to jail such miscreants to send a clear signal
230,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Last night just before midnight was walking towards the zebra crossing, just a few metres away. White sedan was racing towards it too, it’s as if they would die having to wait 5 seconds for me to cross first, I didn’t wanna take any chances so I stopped before crossing and waved my arms to signal go ahead lah go go hurry up, (with a slight tinge of wtf bruh) and they zoomed away. Of course this isn’t the standard which is why it’s a problem, seems like patience is a disappearing trait."

237,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Just... stand there and get hit... sure it a lose situation but at least it a lose win win type. U get free mc, Instagram story of the accident, free medical bill. Also u know his coming so u can cushion the crash"
238,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Sometimes we can only depend on educating these drivers and hope for the best. You wanna put more fines, cameras, etc? Sure but let's be honest to ourselves, there will always be that subset of citizens who will go ""we are a police state! Cameras everywhere! Omg, we losing freedom!..."" or ""we will always be a fine city... PAP = pay and pay..."" well... welcome to Singapore where citizens demand freedom but can't behave even with laws and regulations..."
239,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Lol some of you Singaporeans have no chill that’s why. I love transferring in changi but it’s so funny… only in SQ business class do you see grown ass men RUN to cut as soon as the seatbelt sign is off to get off the plane first. Never see that behavior in other Asian airlines first/biz class. Some of your wealthy people are poor in mindset
240,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Personal experience: was about to cross a zebra crossing but I saw this car zooming towards me - still a bit of distance away from me. Somehow that day something in me told me not to cross it and just to let the car go first no matter what. True enough, the car showed no signs of stopping and really didn’t stop at all - in fact was going quite fast and even accelerating. When I looked over at the driver, he didn’t even notice that I was there. Throughout the whole thing his head was just turned towards the right, looking out for oncoming cars from the main road because he wanted to rush out into the main road 🙄🙄   This was in the day and I was wearing bright coloured clothes. Totally no reason for him not to spot me"
241,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Probably play too much GTA alr
242,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Agree. Doubt it's just the newer batch of drivers tho. More than 10years ago, as a pedastrian, I was an inch away to getting hit by a speeding car. While crossing the road on a green man. It wasn't even a turning car, just speeding straight beating a red light.  As a road user, drivers are damn self entitled and impatient. They are overconfident of their reaction time and think ""driver faster = more skills."" Alot dont practice defensive driving and act/react with their emotions instead of their brain."
243,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Singaporean drivers just suck. I miss Australia
244,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"There was once I was crossing a zebra crossing. It was peak hour and cars were lining up back to back.  When I start to cross, a ah beng car that is highly modified decide to speed up. I let it go and just when the back bumper was very near me, I gave it a very hard kick.   That car stopped suddenly but he couldn’t get out as there were many cars waiting behind him and it was a narrow single lane.  The only regret was I didn’t kick hard enough to dislodge the bumper"
245,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Singaporean drivers genuinely remind me of 3rd world countries where there is little to no legal liability for causing accidents. People press gas and brake alternatively every 3 seconds like fuel is free or some shit. They cross 4 lanes to exit because their early-onset Alzheimer’s struck and they forgot they needed to exit. They **slam** on the brakes to make sure they keep minimum following distance rather than braking slowly like someone who has more than 3 brain cells left. OR they merge *into another vehicle* because God forbid they use a signal and merge into space.  I would never want to drive here. Nothing is predictable and people do absolutely crazy shit every 5 minutes.
246,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),My grandma got hit by an accelerating car at a zebra crossing and ended up in the hospitals. I hate these kind of drivers
247,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Maybe we can have mandatory refresher courses that shows the consequences of reckless driving, and to emphasise safe habits?"
248,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Too many drivers cannot be trusted to make good judgements and this is why most discretionary right turns are being removed. Although this will slow down traffic, I think it is the right move and generally accepted by everyone.  I am a driver and I am glad that most of you are safe pedestrians, but I have seen my fair share of reckless pedestrians. They are the ones who do not look before crossing the roads (not at zebra crossings) and many are parents with children in tow. Then, there are also the youngsters who are engrossed on their phones or who are isolated from the world on their earphones/ headphones.  I wonder whether Singapore is breeding a whole new generation of people who do not have the skills to cross roads safely!"
249,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),I give a thumbs up to drivers who dont stop at zebra crossing
250,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),i would gladly trade places with you so i can be isekaied
251,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I wrote to LTA to build a bump before zebra cross and the answer is to friendly and wait for the drivers to let you go 🤣🤣🤣. Speeding and drive pass is quite common but not all drivers are bad. But I really hope LTA shall consider building higher road bump to slow speeding vehicles down a bit, please do consider 🙏🙏🙏"
252,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"If I want to report to traffic police, I must have video evidence right?"
253,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Drivers here sux and are of poor quality.
254,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),There is no stress if you want to drive decently. I frequently let crazy drivers cut into my lane if they want to. As long as you are not bothered with 'losing out' it is extremely stress-free.
255,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),They should make it harder to earn/renew a driving license. At the least this keeps people who are bad at driving out of the scene.
256,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Uh you complain to traffic police and ask then to install camera or something there. Red light offence is 12 demerit points i think. However, accelerating at a yellow light, I think that one is natural. People do not like waiting."
257,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"I usually wait for the cars to stop/slow down before crossing the zebra crossing.   In some cases where the cars still insist on zooming past me, I will kick/hit their cars as they zoomed past. This usually scared the living daylight out of them as the sound will be very loud in the vehicle. I then dared them to come out of their vehicles. So far none did."
258,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),The big 3 of Singapore driving  Accelerate at pedestrian crossing  Accelerate at stop line  Don’t ever signal at all
259,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Only drivers i have seen jumping red signals are public bus drivers !!
260,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Not all bus drivers are great drivers, not sure why you’re highlighting them. Many of them run red lights, cross many lanes suddenly without properly watching traffic, leave on their turn signals without intention to change lanes and often impatient with pedestrians crossing. Not saying all of them, there are many decent ones, but it’s similar to the 20-30% figure you highlighted. Also most of the ones that aren’t great drivers seem to be foreigners"
261,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),But yet those same drivers drive so slowly on the expressway. Just why?????
262,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),Buy a car or get out of the way
263,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),"Nope nope the drivers are mostly assholes here. Same thing on the left/right turn on green. Many times the cars dgaf, I nearly got hit alot of times near my house. I usually stare at the driver, but I should just take note of their number plate next time. SMH"
264,Almost got murdered by a car accelerating at a pedestrian crossing (again),International drivers who don’t know rules?

This includes the areas of Changi, the stretch between the East Coast area and Marina Bay, and the Greater Southern Waterfront district.  > The event was attended by Minister of Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan Jin, both of whom participated in the conversations.  > The participants expressed their hope that nature-based coastal protection measures would be used and that key recreational and personal property would be safeguarded, amongst other things.  > While these discussions have been opportune for voicing various perspectives, Oceanographer Danielle Su, 32, said that they have also been a vital space to discuss policy trade-offs.  > For example, Dr Su acknowledged that the intertidal zone - the wildlife-rich area where the ocean meets the land between high and low tides - will likely disappear when sea levels rise by a metre in 2100.  > As a result, these zones may not be considered essential for a future coastal protection strategy.  > Citing her sentimental but doomed attachment to the intertidal zone, Dr Su said: ""So what's the best way forward? Should we try to protect the coast by attempting to keep everything the same, or do we have to embrace the mindset of change?""  > She added: ""These places where we grew up may not be the same for future generations, and we have to learn to let them go.""  --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

The whole thing about policy-making here has many parallels with what you see in the army. It’s not supposed to be the most logical/best or whatever, it’s something that can supposedly hold up to scrutiny from a COI or something like that.  NSF die of heat stroke? Ok water parade. Mandate all soldiers drink 1 litre before activity. Tada. Happen again, then some jack ass up there will say maybe 1 litre isn’t enough and then increase water intake or some other shit like buddy system.   Same for MOE’s policy here. Lots of buzzwords. Streamline, buddy-system, support. “Neh, got do something ma.” Any big tai ji, go COI, it’s department implementation problem, not policy problem.  Edit/mini side-rant: I feel that one of the main differences is civil servants from LKY’s era were more of a ‘do-er’. They had to do things and solve problems. There’s no lengthy policy writing blablabla to save your ass if you messed up. Nowadays when ministers or top civil servants comment on our problems, it feels like listening to some external consultant coming into your workplace. Nice suit, nice slides, paid very well but you’re full of shit."
377,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"I want to add that parents play a _massive_ role in this stress.  A huge source of stress comes from student behaviour - where is that inherited?  Then there is this article showing shit that teachers have to go through cos of parents:  https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/difficult-parents-teachers-children-resilience-1990411  Quoting above: The minister cited an example of how one school had deployed teachers for ""corridor duty"": Keeping a lookout for children who fall down along the corridors, so that the teachers could inform children’s parents about accidents that occurred and how exactly they happened.  And a few articles on how overbearing parents send teachers messages and ask on homework.  How much more work is that for our teachers?!  I agree that our teachers are incredibly overworked and underappreciated. I also agree that many civil servant paper pushers, including the higher echelons, are out of touch. But don't forget that we as the recipients of teachers' services, don't seem to show empathy in the way we treat them as well."

379,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"10 years into the service. Here's my take.   Reducing the class size from 28 to 23 students in a mid-tier Junior College does the following: (1) reduces the marking of a typical 10-mark (4-part) biology assignment by 20-30 min per class (each teacher takes 3-4 classes). (2) reduces the chasing for MC/parent letters, monitoring and reminding SLS online lecture viewing & assignment submissions. (3) reduces the time taken to write conduct remarks for progress reports by 30-40 min per class per progress report.  And these are just the tangible, quantifiable aspects of the work. A reduction of just 5 students per class will also reduce overall time needed to tackle class dramas, student personal problems that affect their academics, discipline matters and parent communications.  Benefits of hiring more teachers (so that class sizes can be smaller) also extends to department work being ""cut into"" smaller, more manageable slices for each teacher. A 3-man team has to cover the same syllabus, set the same number of exam papers, organise enrichment activities, plan the same 4-term Scheme of Work as a 4-man team. But with a 33.3% increase in the work just by virtue of being in a smaller team.   Just. Hire. More. Teachers. Please. Following a strict student-teacher ratio across the board and ignoring that different departments have different demands on the teachers borders on wilful ignorance."

We need more of those who didn't succeed in this education system, because they represent a substantial group of people who find it difficult to thrive in this education system. And eventually when there is sufficient representation, there will be higher priority to fix these issues the *right* way.    In short, we are suffering from survivorship bias that is rampant in their thinking."

385,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"92% of teachers working when they’re unwell is such a crazy reality. When I get sick, my first thought it always “Oh no, but it’s my long day. Maybe I should just go to school today then take mc if I really need it the next day.” Imagine having to plan MCs when you’re unwell.   And the day you take MC is never truly a break. I still respond to parents, I still communicate with the relief teachers. I still collaborate with colleagues to update on ongoing projects. I still do marking, I still do planning."
386,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,I would say that Chan Chun Sing isn’t the cause of all this. He’s the unfortunate face of the ineptness shown by the policymakers at MOE. It’s quite well known in the fraternity that the Ministry is clueless about what goes on in schools. Plenty of the senior management in the Ministry are seconded from other ministries and stat boards; this is just another rung in a series of fly-by tours for them.

390,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"Thing is, there are *many* bad teachers in the system. And one of the bigger contributors to mental stress is others having to pick up the slack from these people.   It’s really easy to be a slack teacher if you have little ambition and don’t really see teaching as a calling but just a paycheck. Teachers who leave at the same time as students and never give any consultation. Teachers who do minimal marking by just asking students to “peer mark” or just going through answers in class. Teachers who conveniently disappear when there are things to do. Teachers who feign ignorance to avoid work. Teachers who care so little they can teach a class for a year and still not know everyone’s names and faces. If you don’t really care to progress your career it’s pretty easy to coast on 40 hours a week in school, of which only 40% is classroom time and the rest can just be *ignored*. Who needs yo prepare lessons anyway?  Then there are teachers who are just *dumb*. Lots of them around. Many teachers only have their specific content knowledge and nothing else. Asking them to do work is like potty-training toddlers. Whether they are just pretending or not is secondary to the fact that often it’s easier to just *do their share of the work* then to work together.   Then there are your career HODs and SHs who have been promoted to their maximum incompetence but yet remain at their roles because the system sucks at kicking them down. They are stuck in their ways, only care about their own programmes, block other people’s progression, refuse to step down or retire, and generally just make everyone else’s lives difficult.   These people exist because nobody gets fired. Remove the “iron rice bowl” mentality and the system will get much better.   Some have suggested cutting down on marking. How can you teach your students effectively without marking their work? How would you know whether they have learned, where their weak spots are? Assessment is a core component of effective pedagogy and not optional.   Some have suggested off-loading CCA responsibilities. Have they forgotten we are not tuition teachers? We’re supposed to care about the holistic child. CCAs are where we develop students’ soft skills, their character and morals.   Some criticise the appraisal system. I must agree it sucks but it’s not going away anytime soon given it’s the same system used by the entire civil service.   Maybe one day we’ll actually have smaller class size. I’ll vote for whoever promises that!"

398,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"A large part of the problem is the iron rice bowl itself.  Someone mentioned “stupid” teachers earlier. Incompetence in this line of work is somewhat rewarded. It takes 4-5 years worth of getting a D grade before a teacher can be considered for dismissal. This means 4-5 years of extensive documentation, mentoring from ALL levels for the school strata, and involving people on the super scales. It also means that you’re almost certainly condemning 4-5 years worth of students to a horribly incompetent teacher.   What about management that is also “incompetent”? Heads who cannot roll with the times, get with all the changes. What do they do? Pass the work on to the younger ones who know powerpoint and Google and all that jazz. Then they can talk about how their reportees are so innovative and whatnot. All the while they inflict their archaic notions of education on the younger ones who struggle between doing the right thing and simply giving in to the person who decides your bonus.  What if the “incompetence” goes even higher up? Well, that’s just impossible because they can’t possibly have chosen the wrong person for the job right? I mean, principals and vice-principals must gone through many many rounds of vetting, so how could they be screw ups?  I’ve heard CCS speak before. I know people (who I respect) who would vouch for him. Yes some of the policies announced lack… sense. But he’s really just the guy at the top of system that can’t punish mediocrity and incompetence."

SCC report has a serious response bias.  The SCC starts an online survey on mental health, then emails out to SOME teachers (it is unclear where this email list is from, is it from teachers who have engaged with the counselling services?), then they use snowball sampling (increasing participants in a non-random way) and then through their own social media (i.e: teachers who have been following SCC content)  Then they conclude that yes, there is a serious mental health issue for teachers.  One might as well as Worker Party to do an online survey asking whether citizens are happy with the government -- send this survey out to WP mailing list, ask people to refer others to fill in the survey and also ask them on WP IG and newsletter to fill in the survey."

425,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"> The previous education minister also [insinuated that our teachers are not experienced enough to make smaller class sizes work](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/moe-cautious-issue-smaller-class-sizes-ong-ye-kung) and cites studies that say smaller class sizes do not relate to better achievement, but ignores all the others that show a positive correlation.  A bit hard to see how your source supports your “summary”.  > ""Let me put MOE's position on this straight: With good teachers, smaller class sizes help the students. Our teachers can attest to that through first-hand experience,"" he said. ""Why then is MOE cautious on the issue of class size? Because how it is implemented makes all the difference.""  > He then brought up various international studies, which concluded that there was no major impact on students' performances when they were in smaller class sizes.  > One of these was a 2009 study done in Hong Kong. In a pilot involving 700 classes which were varied in sizes along the way, researchers found ""no significant differences on performances compared to the territory-wide average"".  > Instead, they discovered that an experimental school or class performed better because **they have experienced principals,** who played an active role in the curriculum and developing teachers as well as encouraging parental involvement.  > Another study in Israel, the finding was that there was no significant relationship between class size and achievement.  > A 2011 study in the United States turned out similar findings, and a key reason was that with smaller classes, many new, inexperienced teachers were hired and they have yet to be effective in classrooms.  So here’s what the article says:  * experienced **principals**, not teachers make the difference.  * cites TWO studies, one in Israel and one in US, remarks that the US one didn’t show a difference because of inexperienced teachers. But didn’t say what caused the Israel one to show a difference.  It’s a stretch to say that he’s finger pointing at teachers because he cited an Israel, Hong Kong, and US study. If there’s only one study that said it’s teachers - yes, there’s a point. But looking at three studies and with two studies pointing to different causes (of which one is teachers), it’s hard to say he’s insinuating it’s only teacher experience that matters. Unless you focus on that one paragraph without reading the context.  And then you go on to later in the article, which says:  > Ms Kuik said: ""I know MOE has argued that teacher quality matters more than class size, but the sheer volume of work to be done with such large numbers of students will constrain even the most talented teacher.""  It seems explicit that MOE focus is not teacher *experience* but *teacher quality*."

From the survey by the counselling centre it seems like workload is the main problem - if so, is there any redundant work being foisted on teachers, and can the system be improved? When I was schooling I had some teachers who were good role models and taught the curriculum well - it didn't seem like they had to spend crazy amounts of work/effort to achieve this.

434,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"Actually, in training to be an educator, you can basically choose to be a teacher or a principal. But of course becoming a principal is not easy, but if you are talented in the field, you should be sitting in the principal's office by 35( I think). This is of course possible if you are already successful in your studies and in this case further studies. Another route is seen as painful and difficult while taking many more years. Becoming a teacher, then a vice-principal after great success in your actual teaching career with many awards and much recognition, then eventually a principal. This route is much more respectable as the holder of the principal role is much more experienced and a definitely a highly-skilled educator. This would ultimately lead to better understanding of teachers' and students' needs. Those that dive deeper into the path of an educator might find themselves back in school, and end up as the higher-ups who overlook schools in MOE. The problem is through the more respectable path, the educator would already be nearing retirement. So we often end up with lowly-experienced people manning our booths, selling drinks to our teachers who want food."

I personally gotten Salmonella before, though it was not in Singapore. I had the affected egg for dinner and by midnight, I was awakened by extreme painful stomachache, pulsing migraine and high fever. I had multiple runs to the toilet and even puked one time. It was legit painful and I was totally unprepared for it.  Thankfully, I saw a doc, took antibiotics and recovered after a few days.   The scary thing is you can be perfectly fine and healthy now and the next thing you know, you become plagued by the bacteria and suddenly become crippled for those few days.

447,"S'pore woman attends first spin class, finds blood in urine 2 days later, goes to A&E","I disagree with a lot of these group workout classes that use peer pressure to force students to reach their limits as they are very flawed. Most injuries happen because they haven’t adapt their muscles to get use to high stress. Also some trainers are not skilled themselves and have KPIs to hit such as having the most gold medals in the class (like BFT)  In BFT, the method to get gold is to have the highest heart rate in the class during workouts which is very inaccurate as a measure of a good workout (Good workouts must concentrate on form) So you can imagine this actually forces participants to do fast workouts with the worst form in history. Not to mention heart rate is subjective, even Olympic runners have slow days with slower heart rates! Just doing HIIT all the time will cause injuries and burnout. These classes use a group setting and peer pressure, and students want to show off to their classmates.  I can gym and run everyday because I have been training for years but even when I just started out, I am only training it for 3-4 times a week and I don’t push myself. My advice to people getting into fitness? Go listen to podcasts and read to get more knowledge. Or hire a coach and certified trainer who knows their shit."

452,"S'pore woman attends first spin class, finds blood in urine 2 days later, goes to A&E","I'm a chronically active person. Meaning, potato in between.  Our lifestyle is more sedentary than ever. Meaning our lows in terms of activity is way worse than our parents. To the point where youth doesn't even mitigate enough the impact if you were to dive back into sports and exercise again.  Many people just decide to exercise again. And they go into it. If they keep to it and life goes on nothing happens, good.  Every so often, people take the 8 hours of rest prior to exercise too lightly. Or no strenuous activity 3 days after a flu/cold. Light activity for an individual just coming out of a potato vegatative state is still strenuous activity. And then they turn up on the news for not so pleasant reasons.  Take your time to exercise. Take a month to condition yourself slowly. Brisk walks to get your heart used to a prolonged increased rate. Do stretching to get your body limber again, just so if you sprain anything, nothing tears. Do yoga if you must. Even your vascular system needs to get used to the increased blood flow.  Take it easy guys. No need to go hard when you start."

The thing is that most people don't know that most in the studio would be fitter than them unless they are attending a beginner's class, i.e., people that are regulars are more likely attend a class, and thus in any given class, you are likely to find more regulars.   Pushing yourself to match them when they have been fit for years, and all you've been doing is sitting is simply a recipe for disaster."

468,Malay/Muslim groups need to collaborate strongly to tackle social issues: DPM Wong,"It's disappointing business-as-usual that instead of being incentivised people are being asked to help out of the goodness of their hearts. Just because you are a PMET with post-secondary qualification doesn't mean that you aren't struggling with the cost of living crisis or horrible work-life balance. The disenfranchisement of Malay/Muslims in the workplace (colleagues speaking to each other in Chinese, non-halal gatherings, Tudung discrimination) means that they have even less capacity to volunteer their time. If silver generation ambassadors can get paid for their labour so can minorities."

PMET refers to professionals, managers, executives and technicians.  > Malay/Muslim organisations, such as self-help group AMP Singapore, need to collaborate strongly with one another, as well as the Government, to address social issues that are increasingly becoming multi-faceted and complex, said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.  > ""There will be times when our starting points and methods differ. There will be occasions where we have different views. But so long as we are all focused on the same goal and the common ground we share as Singaporeans, I am confident that we can work together to make everyone better off,"" he said.  > He added that to make a real impact, different community partners need to come together to provide holistic interventions and strong wraparound support.  > He noted that as Singapore moves forward, the needs of its society are becoming more complex and diverse.  > He said: ""That's why we must come together with a family-centric approach - mobilising resources across different entities to meet the needs of the family, rather than forcing the family to cater to our own organisational silos.  > ""If we take that family-centric approach, I believe we can make progress in uplifting more families, and ensure that Singapore remains a place where everyone can aspire towards a better life.""  > The Government will continue to invest heavily in the people, said Mr Wong. It will work to equip citizens with relevant capabilities and skills and give everyone the extra advantage to progress and excel in their careers and professions.  > Mr Wong said what AMP Singapore is doing today for the community is exactly what the 4G leadership team hopes to achieve for the country with the Forward Singapore nationwide engagement exercise to build a fairer and more inclusive society.  > He added: ""Crucially, this exercise is not just about what the Government can do.

470,"As someone who prefers chicken thigh/drumstick, this is jackpot from KFC delivery","My time to shine, don’t know if it’s still in practice now but when I used to work at KFC the 5 different cuts (thigh, breast, drum, wing, rib) were classified as either meat or bone (I’m almost certain this is wrong, it’s been a while). Wings and ribs were bone, rest were meat.  When orders came in we packed according to a set ratio depending on how many pieces ordered.   2 pc - 1 meat, 1 bone   3 pc - 2 meat, 1 bone   6 pc - 4 meat, 2 bone   15 pc - 3 of each of the 5 types (iirc, this was a rare order)   21 pc - shift grinds to a halt and comes out to the front to see who’s the loaded fella who ordered a bucket    So if they’re still doing it like the 90’s you definitely lucked out boyo.  Bonus fun fact, I still rmbr the order in which you laid out the chicken pieces in the grille basket before you plunk it into the pressure cooker.  Top shelf   Wing drum breast wing drum wing drum   Bottom shelf   thigh, breast,drum, repeat  And that’s my contribution to the bajillion bytes of useless data generated  today."

652,"Pofma correction orders issued to ex-GIC economist, TOC over false claims","I get that the land and cash swap statement is because of fair value accounting: in double entry speak,the value of such state land as recognised in the financial statements are reflected in 2 accounts, (1) non-current assets and (2) revaluation reserve. I am guessing the revaluation to fair value occurs every financial year and it is recorded as unrealised gains until…it is realised. So it is a swap as far as the accounts of the past reserve are concerned.  So, technically, HDB making a loss on these purchases is actually the result of the fair value accounting treatment adopted by the government in reporting past reserve amounts. So, it does seem that it can be characterised as accounting “sleight of hand”. Then in HDB own financial reporting, it is paying cash for this combination of land at cost (purchased at Land Acquisition Act prices) together with this fair value revaluation, i.e., the book value as reflected in the past reserves.   HDB wouldn’t be making a loss constantly if it budgeted better, e.g., rolling budget, that actually reflected the fluctuations in land prices in Singapore as well as the housing subsidies expected to be paid out, should translate into receiving a more generous budget that matched the realities of the property market. Basically, the $270,000,000 loss could actually just be setting low financial targets then deliberately exceeding them. But why deliberately make a loss?   If I am mistaken in any way, I would appreciate it if someone would correct me."

663,Commentary: 'Kidney tsunami' looming large — why even the young should take action now,"Why fat cell size mattersLarge fat cells, he said, are already filled with fat. They cannot store much more and tend to leak some of their overstuffed contents into the bloodstream as fatty acids. From there, the fatty acids slosh toward and lodge in other organs, such as the heart, muscles or liver. Fatty, well-marbled livers, muscles or hearts are undesirable (unless, perhaps, you raise steers).  Small fat cells, on the other hand, can expand, essentially slurping fat from your blood. You want fat to stay inside fat cells, Horowitz said.Healthy fat cells also contain reams of active mitochondria, the power centers of any cell. Mitochondria convert oxygen and food into cellular energy. In general, the more mitochondria, the healthier and more resilient any cell will be, including fat cells.Finally, healthy fat tissue teems with blood vessels, to ferry oxygen and nutrients to fat cells, along with battalions of other cells, most related to immunity, that help fight inflammation. Without sufficient blood supply and immune protection, fat tissue often becomes inflamed and scarred and releases substances into the bloodstream that initiate similar, unhealthy inflammation elsewhere in our bodies, even in people who are not overweight.How exercise can remodel your fat cellsUntil recently, though, scientists were not sure whether or how much our fat could change. That is, they knew healthy fat tissue could deteriorate, filling with large, leaky cells, dysfunctional mitochondria and inflammation.But whether this process could be reversed or slowed remained unclear. Some studies in recent years involving rodents were encouraging, suggesting physically active animals harbored metabolically healthier body fat compared with sedentary rodents, even if they were all overweight by rodent standards.But we are not lab mice and many questions remained about the malleability of our body fat.  “Exercise training meant more mitochondria and better functioning mitochondria” and, in essence, healthier fat, said Anders Gudiksen, a professor of cell biology at the University of Copenhagen, who led the study.But for anyone who might not have had the foresight to be a lifelong cyclist, another new study offers hope that starting to exercise now, no matter how sedentary you may have been, could rapidly improve your fat’s fitness.For the new study, published in the Journal of Physiology and overseen by Horowitz, researchers biopsied fat tissue from 36 sedentary men and women with obesity and then asked them to ride a stationary bike at a moderate pace for 45 minutes or more intensely for a 20-minute interval workout four times a week for 12 weeks.  The volunteers’ diets were carefully monitored, so they would not lose weight. Otherwise, Horowitz said, changes in their fat tissue might have been due to weight loss, not exercise.But without shedding pounds, the exercising volunteers still remade their fat. They wound up with substantially more small fat cells, as well as more capillaries to nourish those cells. Their fat tissue also held fewer biochemical markers of inflammation and less symptoms of scarring and hardening around the fat cells.These effects were seen, whether the volunteers rode moderately or hard. “Intensity didn’t matter,” Horowitz said, only that they were active.  In the short term, these alterations should make fat tissue more capable of slurping up and storing any excess calories someone takes in with large meals during the holidays, Horowitz said, a scenario that does not necessarily mean weight gain. This fat is usually stored temporarily, soon converted into energy for other tissues, like muscles. But in the meantime, he said, it is better to warehouse such fat in fat cells, not your liver or arteries.The longer-term implications of exercise and fat revolve around inflammation, Horowitz said, and whether and how metabolically healthy fat contributes to a metabolically healthy body, even — and perhaps especially — if people have obesity.  We need more research to fully understand what constitutes healthy fat, he said, and the types and amounts of exercise that best generate or maintain it. But already it seems clear, he said, movement benefits fat, as well as the rest of your body, offering one more reason to ride, walk, jog, swim or, in whatever way you choose, be active today."

668,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","I think I'm in the minority.   Option no. 3: But we split our responsibilities e.g he handles utilities and groceries, I handle child and pet expenses......   We did have a joint account early in our marriage but he emptied it. He has no savings to speak of so I manage our financial planning"
669,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",at first i thought u were a guy with multiple partners lol
670,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Everything is pooled. We do have separate accounts due to legacy reasons, but between us it's understood that regardless of whose account it's in, it's all OUR money. So if one account is running a bit low or another account has more than is needed to earn the best interest or whatever, we freely transfer thousands or tens of thousands across with a couple of sentences exchanged."
671,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Me and my wife only been married for a year, for now we have separate finances but we agreed that at some point (when we move out on our own) we’re gonna make a joint account for household bills and expenses.  I still think that both should have own account also, need some degree of privacy at the end of the day. If I wanna buy something for my wife she doesn’t have to see it on joint acc statement."
672,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",We pooled everything together in joint accounts since we were dating. Not just savings but also spending money. We never had any distinction of who owns what or yours and mine. Every dollar is owned together.
673,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Belong to the completely separate accounts couple. We use our separate bank accounts for savings because joint bank accounts have bad interest rates. For investments, I work in banking so I am very limited in my choice of brokers, so I use my wife's name to open brokers to pool our money in and invest in ETFs. (yes this is legal)."
674,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Married for almost a year.   1) Separate savings account and joint savings account (I monitor this closely)   2) All expenses are charged to a credit card. End of the month the respective party will pay for their share.
675,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Fully separate, split the bills on everything.  Why would it blow your mind?   I never believed in joint accounts because to me I don’t understand the benefit, and the risk is that if one person messes up, both people’s money are lost. It sounds like a joke until you realise this has been happening in the news recently.  Lmao I even have multiple bank accounts just to minimise my losses if any of them gets accessed by someone else."
676,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Option 1  A little freedom in discretionary spending is healthy. However I still tell my wife about stuff I’m getting & vice versa lol.
677,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Might be the oddball here. Married for 3 years, we have completely separate accounts. He pays for himself, she pays for herself. Money is fluid among us so anyone picks up the bill for groceries and household stuffs. Occasionally will just transfer a big sum of money to each other if needed. Big ticket items will be split 50-50."
678,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","My husband (26M) and I (23F) are option 3, as we both had our own bank/savings account individually even before we got together (~4.5 years) and cbf to create a joint account.   Money is very fluid in our household and we don't necessarily split everything 50-50 but splitting who pays for what came very naturally for us (He pays for bills, groceries, I pay for child expenses, misc. etc) If one or the other is falling short on a particular month the other helps to top up or cover that particular expense.   We're quite open with how much we both have and likewise big ticket items are discussed and planned for. I think this works for us as we both have other expenses like giving our parents money, etc. that I feel works better coming out from our own accounts.   When we started dating though, we used to pool our money together so I also wonder when that sorta stopped. Maybe after we starting working full time and earned significantly more? Haha"
679,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Seperate accounts and investments. We discuss what we invest in.  We split groceries 50/50.  I pay for car, internet and phonebills.  She pays power, conservancy and for the dog.  Other expenses (holidays, big ticket items, whatever else) I pay bit more coz I earn more.  Eating out we take turns to pay.   Gifts we buy each other la.     We use Spendee to record all expenses (individually) so can recall if needed."
680,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Separate n Joint.  We decide how much to put into the joint each month . And keep some spare in our own account.
681,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","We have joint and separate accounts. Our salaries go into the joint account each month and we withdraw 20% each month into our separate accounts. The joint account is used for all necessities of our family (food transport children etc) and the separate accounts we use for our own luxury spending (hobbies, branded goods, gifts, etc) or whatever basically. This includes allowance for parents.   Each month I withdraw a fixed amount to another separate personal account to make investments. This was agreed with her as she doesn’t like seeing investments go up and down. However we discussed the overall investment strategy together."
682,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Married for about 8 years living together for about 7 years. We are in the third group. I think for us it’s a bit different because our earning and expenses are quite similar so I also don’t feel the need to know how much he has etc. anyway we talk about our finances too at times and that’s enough for me. No big purchases since we settled our house so ya things work well. He pays for most stuff because I don’t want to have to manage credit cards, but he likes to optimise credit card rewards. I just transfer him based on whatever amount he tells me lol. I think as long as communication is there any of the 3 options are fine really."
683,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","I'm mid 30s and so is my wife. We each have personal accounts and also joint accounts (which is really just my account since only I put money in it). We don't care where the spending is from, usually one of my personal accounts. My money is her money, her money is her money. I don't have any strong opinions about money but sometimes I take a peek at her accounts (she doesnt mind) and I'm impressed at how much she has saved up. I'll leave it to her to manage our savings.  Since I pretty much pay for anything including her cards if I have money lying around for the month, I don't usually have much money in my own accounts apart from some investments I make. If I really not enough money for that month then I'll just ask her to cover it and its always no questions asked anyway.  Some people ask me, wah what if one day she run away with all the money? I really don't know how to respond. It just doesn't even seem possible to me, we spent all our lives together but I guess if she really wants to run away with the money then so be it lor lol."
684,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",What's hers is hers.    What's mine is hers.
685,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",* Separate savings account and joint account for shared expenses  My salary is higher so I tank the household expenses. But still manage to have enough for investment. She has her own investment too. When there's an additional expense I will usually discuss how we are going to finance it. She's quite frugal and I'm actually the one who spends on dumb shit so this works.
686,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","My husband (37M) and I (34F) do option 1+2. Family situation: married for 9 years with twins in primary school.   - Our philosophy is “your money is my money”. Regardless of whose account it is (individual or joint) it is our money.  - shared goal is retirement and 2nd property.  - Very much like OP, full transparency. We track financial goals on an excel family balance sheet and cash flow statement - joint account is for savings and contributing charity donations - expenses equally split: I handle mortgage as the house is in my name, kids education and insurance, and my credit card bills. He handles car expenses, grocery/household/dining/holiday expenses and his own cc bills.  - we contribute the same $ of savings to the joint.  - he is the family’s chief investment officer. I don’t have a brokerage account.   This approach has worked very well for us and is based on mutual trust. But it took us a number of years to get to this mutual understanding, it didn’t happen early on."
687,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","I have a joint account with my wife and we also have separate savings accounts. To be honest, the joint account is as good as don't have because neither of us put money in there.  My wife is a homemaker and I give her an allowance every month. That's cash money mostly for groceries and household expenses. She also has a supplementary credit card which she uses to buy things online or treats for herself."
688,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","We chuck some money each into a joint account each quarter and use that to pay for our mortgage, household expenditure, meals together, etc.   Other than that we have no say in how the other spends their money. We don't update each other on our expenditure.   We're lucky in a sense because we're DINK and earn roughly equal amounts, so we contribute equally to the join account. I can imagine that figuring out an acceptable percentage split might be hard for some couples.    I also manage her passive investment portfolio, and I'm lucky that she understands that I can't just lump our two portfolios together because we have very different risk appetites and investment horizons.  Edit: She had a will drawn up after we got married, and I had mine updated. We both also took out additional individual life insurance to cover the cost of the mortgage if either of us kicks the can unexpectedly."
689,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Option4: give wife fixed amount every month and she pays all family costs.
690,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Sorry to hijack, but do anyone have advice for a couple with big income gap, how do you guys handle finances etc?"
691,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","I earn the money and we both have access to all accounts, however my wife control's the finances. She does taxes, insurance's, mortgages, etc... This is also convenient as I travel a lot for work. And at some point (we are married for quite some time now) you need trust eachother. I am always proud and it makes me very happy knowing that all is in capable hands of her managing complex financial transactions."
692,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Am the sole breadwinner and I put all my salary into my wife’s account and get a monthly allowance from her. Bills are all paid via credit card which she pays off at the end of the month.   She has her own savings account and a joint savings account with my kid but I don’t have any other account. If we need to buy presents for each other etc, we pay using the one credit card we have.   And this is how we manage to buy stuff bcos if left up to me, we wouldn’t have any savings. Lol"
693,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","As a singaporean who got married to an illiterate village girl 9 years back, and moved to her country, I got a rude awakening on the way marital finances are viewed.  In my case, it's customary for the husband to give 100% of his income to the live-at-home wife and ask her for a daily allowance.  Moreover her and her family don't have bank accounts. In fact, I finally convinced my wife to open a bank account after 6 years of marriage, even though she can't do arithmetics to save her life.  Needless to say, my lifestyle changed drastically after marriage.  Because of the matriarchal nature of this social group, there is little room for negotiation.  There is a prevailing theme here of not planning for the future, but rather living for today and focusing on today's expenses.  Thankfully, I make a decent living as remote software engineer, and although it's hard for me to keep a secret from my wife, I started keeping a private bank account in Singapore, and am secretly paying the insurance premiums for her and my children using that stash.  However, after 9+ years and 2 kids, I've finally walked away and am in the midst of a bitter custody negotiation.  My point in all this was, the way couples manage shared finances is not a big deal in itself.  But the decided agreement will reflect, in time, the mindsets of the parties involved. Shedding light on more nuanced parts of their real inner person."
694,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Separate and joint savings accounts, but also joint account for shared expenses"
695,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",All or most of our savings are pooled together. I just keep some as I have pretty expensive hobbies 😂  But finances wise we decided to just pool everything together.
696,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Option 1. Separate account and 1 joint account for expenses.  Joint account only for household related stuffs such as groceries, bills,  home appliances and etc.  Food we use our own account, we take turns to pay, never keep track.   Never restrict each other spending as both of us are grown up adults and frugal. We have our own indulgence but in moderation.  I think we should not restrict our partner spending. Should have a common understanding on future plans, amount of money needed and we should only spend/invest with all these plans considered.  E.g childcare, move house or career switch.  If your other half have money management issue, education is more important than controlling. I am very sure he/she will hide  his pay increment and bonus from you and secretly spend on other things which I don't think is healthy.  Just my opinion"
697,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","10 years. Separate independent accounts. We do not keep track of who pays for what. If we see a bill, we just pay it. It can be a small $10 phone bill or a $5000 renovation, whoever sees it will automatically pay so that the other person does not have to worry about it.  We do not spend excessively in daily life. Monthly total spend <2k per person everything in."
698,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",It's easier to plan finances and retirement when the stash is transparent. I know a couple who keep each other assets a secret so they make weird financial decisions like buying a low end condo cos neither wanna disclose how rich they are.
699,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Separate accounts. I pay rent and utilities, she pays for groceries since I make 2x her salary. She tracks her spending, I don't but I have a hard limit on how much I spend and I save 20% of my salary at least every month"
700,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",My money is my wife's money  My wife's money is her money  Happy wife = Happy life  )=
701,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","1st for me and wife. We both working, earning."
702,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Have been married for 8 years. We never had a joint account and we have separate personal accounts. For big ticket purchases like furniture and Reno in the early days we split it equally, but nowadays for everyday expenses like utilities, internet bills etc we split it where I take care of utilities, she takes care of internet bills and house fees etc. For meals etc we are pretty laissez faire where either one of us picks up the bill. But usually I do so more frequently cause I’m earning higher than her"
703,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","After marriage, total income from both of us goes into a joint account. It was discussed and agreed that we are wholly commited to one another and therefore regardless of employment or financial status, what's hers is mine and what's mine is hers. Term insurance policies and CPF have the other party as the beneficiary. We have been warned not to do this, but our trust and respect for one another is absolute, enough that I trust she will care for my parents financially and emotionally if I die early and vice versa.  We are both very very stingy with money as well so it's great that our personalities match in that sense. We just see our portfolio number grow twice as fast.  However, assets that we gained before marriage including savings, stocks, properties remain singly owned, simply because it was too much of a hassle at that time. Though with 2 young kids now, we are planning to merge the assets allowing us to jointly plan for a bigger home and better financial planning."
704,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Married 10 years. Wife quit work immediately after marriage and has not been working since. Option 2 since she has no money.
705,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",This is all very surprising to me!  I just give all my money to my wife and let her manage. Last time my parents also like that…  Happy wife happy life
706,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Separate accounts because neither can predict what will happen to the relationship.
707,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","On a separate note, how does it work in divorce? 50% of men total money give to the women? What if the finances were shared together?"
708,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Separate accounts still potentially liable to be caught as matrimonial assets in the round, in such unfortunate event of divorce.  Consider a post-nup for evidential value of expressed intentions. If you are fine with making a will or LPA, you're fine with making a post-nup.  Wills and LPAs are not only for dying people. Similarly, marital agreements are not only for unhappily married couples."
709,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",I prefer having 1 shared account for spending
710,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Did not make it to marriage with my exes, but we did discuss it before.   3 major account types per person, no limit to credit or debit or whatever.     Personal expenses - This is where your own personal savings and spending money come from, where your partner can advise but cannot enforce. Meaning if I wanna buy 10 PS5 or blow it on 100 golf clubs, you can advise but not stop me from doing it. Same goes for your pedicure or hermes bag even if I think its utter bullshit.  Minor combined - This is where shared funding comes from, such as groceries, bills, restaurant costs, movie tickets etc. Both parties have free reign to it and can spend it without needed consent so long as its for both parties.  Major combined - This is where all the big ticket payments come from, mortgage, renovations, car costs etc. Both parties must give consent for this account to be tapped on, no single authorisation allowed.  So long as both combined accounts have monthly top up from both parties, 99% of financial problems will be solved.  But of course, this only works with dual income, and both parties are reasonable about it."
711,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",I work.  She spends. (And manage)
712,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","A mix between 1 and 3.   Joint savings account  - strictly for housing down-payments, deposits, renovation, loan repayments.  - We each deposit a fixed amount every month into this account e.g. $500 each. No more, no less.  Shared expenses (groceries, meals out, movies, holidays) are managed using a free app called Splitwise. You can indicate who paid and how to split if not 50%.   We make sure to clear the outstanding balance in the app every month.   https://www.splitwise.com/mobile/splash   Otherwise we keep completely separate accounts. Despite this we know how much savings each person has and what they're doing with their money e.g. endowments, insurance, investments. We talk about this very often.   We have been married for 2 years and together for 4."
713,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Married for 6 years, 2nd time. We follow option 3, mainly because I do not want to see the condition of his finances and get anxious. Hang over from 1st marriage where partner had uncontrolled spending habits n accumulated tons of CC debt. Currently hubby will transfer me his share of any shared household expenses and we split one-off items. My only rule - he cannot have a credit card. Generally any big ticket items are paid for first by me since I have higher income. So only I need a credit card."
714,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Separate accounts. But I track our combined assets in an excel spreadsheet.   I know my wife's banking account details and password but she doesn't know mine.
715,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","basically i settle most of the small bills (e.g. groceries, kids powder & diapers, utilities, etc.) while he settles the big ticket items (e.g. babysitting, maid, downpayment of hdb, vehicle purchase/maintenance, annual insurance premiums).  that aside, all our remaining finances are separated. if the smaller expenses gets too hefty or i have intention to get big tix items like furnitures, i'll discuss with him so that he can fork out a fair share.   this works for us pretty well so far 😀"
716,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","I just give my wife a couple hundred each month to spend as she wishes. Because she’s the prudent one and I trust her. I used to be more spendthrift but now I follow her habits, which really save us a lot of money. Expensive items usually we’ll split the cost. She makes about the same as me and it’s been comfortable so far."
717,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",My wife and I have 1 joint account. I handle all finances and investments.  We have a set budget monthly for all expenses (6k) and we stick to it.
718,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","As someone who’s not married, this question serves as an education for me haha"
719,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","I'm 45m. I manage the finances for both of us, to FI in 10 years. We set a target level of savings/ investments each year, and from there we work out a yearly budget which I review quarterly.  From the budget we have accounts like personal spending, joint spending, etc. I use a tracker to monitor these on a daily basis and tally them up at the end of the year to make next year's budget.  We know how much each other has, and I agree with OP that it's strange to trust each other with the rest of your lives but not cash? BUT as a guy, I also understand its better not to (generally) let's guys have too much money.(purely from anadectol evidence).  So far it works out well as our personal spending accounts allow us to indulge a bit, me on entertainment and wifey on bags/ clothes, but we have a budget so subconsciously we know there's a limit? And it still allows you to stay your long terms course.  Last but not least, yup, whichever way works for the couple is their best way. =)"
720,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","No shared accounts, except my credit card that my wife can use on whatever. No idea how much money she has, not interested to know (unless she needs money desperately for something).   As a side note - I’m probably one of the more motivated people when it comes to making money, but once I earn it I’m not bothered about saving it or just using it on myself - it’s more like a high score in a video game for me (earning) and I’m not bothered about the saving high score.   Money creates jealousy and problems so the less I know the less I’m likely to be negatively influenced by those issues."
721,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Third option mainly to maximise multiplier account benefits!  We usually go dutch but from time to time we treat each other to a meal. We have been discussing having a joint account and contributing to it in equitable share but have been too lazy to set it up haha. Perhaps when a kid comes into the picture we will finally do it.  This goes against my marriage counselling (as a Christian, technically when 2 people are married they become 1, which I suppose extends to the financial side of things). But I think it's important to have your personal stash of money just in case things go south."
722,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Seperate finances. We don't have a joint account. Big ticket items are shared 50/50 if it's a household item like car, Renos, furniture. Utilities like internet, SCC, childcare and medical are shared but personal stuff like mobile is ownself pay. I pay groceries, child's milk+diapers, electricity, she pay for his clothes.  We know each other's savings but we of course dont touch. What's yours is yours. She has like 40x of what I have 😭"
723,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Separate accounts and expenses split 70-30.
724,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Get a mutually agreed amount to put in joint…save what you can for your ownself with what’s left :) for expenses like dining out, we take turns.  For the house expenses, we split so for example, i pay utilities and she pays for groceries…worked out well so far"
725,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Joint acc for the housing mortgage and common expenses. We each contribute an amount to this every month. Separate individual accounts for savings, we also manage our investments individually. All of our common expenses are charged to a miles credit card or the credit card we use specifically for petrol rebates."
726,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","If you need, me & my wife married for some time Doing option 1 ,  The joint saving is for our expenses for our family members like treat in- laws /parents out for dinner/oversea trips then both of us make a monthly contribution to this joint saving account.  Option 1 is very important as it prevent arguement on whose right to spend on what. When pool all earning together , the issue of one spending more than the other become a really big problem in most relationship"
727,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Married for a year, separate accounts.  Maybe when the BTO is done, then will have a joint account to pay the bills from, but each of us will still maintain our own separate private accounts.  U earn the moolah, u contribute abit for the house (joint account) and u can spent on whatever u like (private separate accounts)."
728,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Separate accounts. But we have an app that we share to calculate our shared expenses. Personal items are not included.
729,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",wouldnt option3 (no idea how much the other has in savings) apply to option 1 too?
730,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Married with 2 kids. Completely separate accounts, but we split household expenses 50-50. We keep notes on how much we spend, then clear debts every month. Our finances are open, and we can see each other's accounts any time we ask."
731,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Joint account where both salaries were pooled in. We also have separate accounts on our own.   I supposed each situation is different. My better half couldn’t be too bothered with utilities bills for eg, and I managed them.   I supposed the level of trust is important. We started with this arrangement from the start and it has never been an issue sans a couple of times where we disagree with the expenses.   I supposed we are soulmates."
732,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Separate accounts. Husband pays for everything that’s necessary for living (food, house, utilities). Wife’s money is for whatever she wants that the husband does not cover."
733,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Not married but kinda living tog. No joint account, household expenses all i pay. Big ticket items he pay. He has access to my bank and vice versa so we know each other’s money flows."
734,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",To OP: How do you all save for retirement/investments? Or you don't know how much retirement savings each other has?
735,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",We’ve separate bank accounts and a joint account. But the joint account is mostly dormant. All the monthly expenses are paid from my account and the wife’s account is left untouched. She also uses a card linked to my account for her daily expenses. We also use an app to track our monthly expenses and the monthly expenditure is transparent to both
736,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","wife earns 50% I do, so we just use a percent based type deal.  20% take-home into a joint account. A joint credit card used to spend groceries, utilities, holidays together etc. I do however put $400 per month into wife's stashaway for her retirement.   Everything else like solo trips are spent from own savings."
737,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","We have split accounts, but hubs pays the utilities bills and eating out, i pay for groceries."
738,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Well my wife and I, who am I kidding I am bbfa. My both hands share the same account."
739,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","My husband and I have completely separate accounts. We are both fervent believers of ""your money is your money, my money is my money"".  We split our expenses in this way:  HUSBAND - car - bills, utilities, wifi - town council - children's insurance - credit card installments (larger household stuff, furniture)  WIFE (ME) - groceries - kids expenses (like ezlink card, stationery, etc) - occasional petrol support for husband  Anything else is split 50/50 - student care - enrichment classes - dining out - overseas travel  This arrangement works for us. And my husband earns significantly more than me, so financially he pays slightly more, even for our hdb loan repayment. Whereas for me, I spend more time with the kids like sending them to/fetching them from school."
740,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",I pay for everything   We’re still married after 10yrs with 2 kids  So I win
741,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","We have separate savings and a joint account (mainly funded 50/50 though he earns more than double) for certain shared expenses, like the house and pet. We do not discuss big-ticket items unless it's for our house or a very expensive trip together. We do not know what the other spends on.  I do wish we shared everything - before we got married, I was rising in my career, making more, and he kept saying his money is my money. I decided to help him progress in his career while taking care of and managing everything, covering a lot of costs too when I was earning more. My health eventually deteriorated. I found out after I got sick and took a hiatus that his idea of ""his money is my money"" involves just covering most cheap meals - just a few hundred dollars a month. I ended up using my rainy-day fund during my break from work to cover my other expenses.  I am honestly curious what housewives/house husbands are doing - since everyone does need money for retirement. I am back to working on my health and trying to get back to full-time work again. I've rebuilt my rainy-day fund and hope to again set aside money for my own spending/investing/retirement. I've realised that I cannot depend on my husband, even if he now earns more than double what he did when he met me. This money now goes to his own expenses - though I am now trying to get him to set aside a proportionate ratio of his salary towards our new house."
742,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","Together for 10 years and option 3. I am minority. I dont believe in being so calculative to split equally. He pays for house and meals and food, i pay for kid and whatever is running out in the house cos women somehow keep tracks whats running out… haha. I have no idea how much he earns and neither does he LOL. Maybe we know roughly a range? I dont see a reason to know his and vice versa… he has never compromised on dates or quality of our lives and that is what matters. We and I am too lazy to track shared expenses on spreadsheet then divide by 2….  But we are both generally prudent in spending so this works for us.!"
743,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?",Keep all his money and only give him enough allowance. Then he can’t play punk.
744,"Married folks, how do you manage finances with your partner?","separate savings accounts and joint account for shared expenses. before marriage and kids we've agreed that all kid related expenses, i.e. pregnancy, delivery and baby, will all be paid by him cos i didnt want kids. plus i dont think it is fair to me to have to sacrifice my income, body, mental and physical health to have his kids and still pay for half of the expenses."

766,"/r/singapore random discussion and small questions thread for October 15, 2022","just euthanised a lizard and I feel a little sad and angry, but somewhat also numb and dead inside.  The lizard was trapped in those NEA mosquito monitoring traps, skin stuck to the layer of glue. The lizard’s eye was open, responsive to stimuli, and only its neck and head was not glued onto the sides of the trap. However, there was a bunch of ants eating the lizard alive, working their way around its more delicate parts (under its body, nostrils, and eyes).  As there was no way to remove the lizard from the glue (no adhesive remover) and a lot of the lizard’s skin was stuck to the glue, I couldn’t find any way to set the lizard free without severely injuring it so…I decided to rinse off as much of the ants as I could with running water, taking care to not drown it. Then, I found some leaves, made a small bed for it, found a cinderblock, said some final words, and crushed its head.  I’m sad that the lizard was suffering. I’m angry that the lizard was suffering because the person who did the trap did not fully set it up correctly, by not putting the lid on to prevent, as much as possible, small animals from getting in because he didn’t care or out of sheer incompetence. I feel dead inside because I can’t care any more than I can allow myself to, as I am already very worried for my grandparents in their ill health and a hamster at home that is showing behavioural changes, yet I can do nothing because as an nsf I have to serve the people I don’t give a damn as much about, in an organisation that I wish to not be a part in, in a system where I can’t take the time and effort to care for those I love.  The world is an unfair place, yes, but I will try, to my last breath, to make it more fair, to fight for those who were dealt the shorter end of the stick"

Anybody would have panicked and lost their rational frame of mind  momentarily upon the realisation they have a dead body with them and that their friend suddenly died. Let alone doing all these disposal of body and maintaining a story to the police. The nerves...   And, what a horrible sad ending for Felicia.

Another two charges were considered in sentencing.  > He had allegedly committed the offences with an accomplice, Mr Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana, who is at large.  > Ahmad Danial was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the murder charge in June this year, after being remanded for about one-and-a-half years.  > Prosecutors said the main reason they asked for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal was because Mr Ragil was still at large, with no evidence that he was dead.  > Ms Teo, who would have been 34 this year, was reported missing on Jul 3, 2007 by her mother.  > The court heard that Ms Teo was a student at La Salle College of Fine Arts at the time, along with Mr Ragil, who was 18 at the time.  > Ahmad was then a 22-year-old graphic designer. Ms Teo's mother lodged a police report on Jul 3, 2007, saying her daughter was missing and uncontactable. She had last seen her daughter on Jun 29, 2007.  > She said her daughter was last seen with Ahmad and Mr Ragil. However, when questioned, Ahmad and Mr Ragil lied to the police that Ms Teo had left the unit to meet someone at East Coast Park.  > Ahmad lied to investigators that Ms Teo had left angrily after he made comments about her having many boyfriends and calling her a ""bitch"".  > However, what really happened was that the trio returned to Mr Ragil's flat in Marine Terrace on the early morning of Jun 30, 2007.  > The trio consumed ecstasy inside the flat. After 6am, Ms Teo died due to unknown circumstances.  > When the two men realised she was dead, they came up with a plan to dispose of her body as they did not want to get into trouble for drug consumption nor go to jail.  > The men placed Ms Teo's body on a mattress in the flat and covered it with another mattress to hide the body. They cleaned up the unit and took her phone, placing it near East Coast Park to mislead the police.  > That same day, the two men went to hardware shops to buy tools to dispose of the body. They then returned to the flat, placed the body in a carton box and sealed it with tape.  > They carried the body to the ground floor via the staircase, to avoid closed-circuit television cameras at the lift lobby.  > They took a cab to Punggol Track 24 with the carton box containing her body. At a deserted location there, they dug a hole in the ground and placed the box in the hole, before pouring kerosene over it and lighting it on fire.  > After the fire died down, the pair covered the hole and left the location before disposing of the tools. That same day, they took Ms Teo's laptop, camera and camera lenses.  > In June 2010, a partial human skull was found during excavation works at Punggol Track 24. The identity of the skull was unknown at the time.  > However, after Ahmad was arrested in December 2020, screenings were conducted on skeletons found in the Punggol area. DNA testing revealed that the skull likely belonged to Ms Teo. No other remains were discovered despite efforts to dig around the area.  > There was no evidence at the time to link Ahmad Danial or Mr Ragil to Ms Teo's disappearance, so it was classified as a missing persons case, with a police gazette issued to find her.  > The case went cold until 2020 when the case was referred to the Criminal Investigation Department as part of police processes for long-standing unsolved missing person cases.  > Fresh leads were found when investigators traced the belongings believed to be in Ms Teo’s possession when she was reported missing.  > Police linked one of her belongings to Ahmad Danial.  > Prosecutors asked for 27 months' jail for Ahmad Danial.  --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"

943,"Will Singapore’s bid for doctors from India, UK, Australia lead to a ‘race to the bottom’?",Healthcare workers’ wages are already artificially depressed by MOH policies.  This is no surprise.
944,"Will Singapore’s bid for doctors from India, UK, Australia lead to a ‘race to the bottom’?","So it ends with an exchange.  SG poaches UK and AU staff with better terms since they cost them nothing to train.  Local staff get disgruntled and get poached by UK and AU, again costing them nothing to train.    The Indians are the main losers: they pay to train staff that are then lost but UK, AU and SG staff don't want to work there."
945,"Will Singapore’s bid for doctors from India, UK, Australia lead to a ‘race to the bottom’?","Relying on recruiting foreigners to solve our healthcare staff shortages - doctors, nurses, allied health etc. is a short term ""solution"" at best, and a long term disaster at worst.  When you train and hire locals... you know the majority of them will be here for the long haul. They are already integrated in the society / have family here etc. Their employment may change from clinic A to hospital B but they'll certainly be contributing to SG healthcare for the next 30-40y. They may cost more in the short term, but we will reap the long term benefits of having a robust workforce dedicated and interested in improving SG healthcare.  When you rely on hiring foreigners.... many of them will be here for a short time only. Many will have issues integrating with society, form their own enclaves, have family back home or elsewhere that will constantly be pulling them away. If they come to SG for higher pay, what happens when another country offers more? If they are here only for the short term, will they be interested in education, quality improvement, development etc? all crucial to the long term trajectory of SG healthcare.  My suspicion and fear is that this is just a means to paper over the cracks. And eventually when the cracks can no longer be covered they will be bigger and deeper than ever before. Just look at the UK NHS... they had a decade of getting drunk on cheap overseas labor... now that they are no longer as competitive pay-wise relative to US/CA/AU/NZ/SG etc.... it's all crumbling apart."

966,Fresh Malaysia chicken fly off shelves despite higher prices,"> # Fresh Malaysia chicken fly off shelves despite higher prices  > SINGAPORE - For the past four months, a 75-year-old retired cook, who gave her name only as Ms Rose, had stopped buying chickens because they were too expensive.  > But she joined the throngs of people at the Bedok 85 market, and around the island, to buy fresh broiler chickens from Malaysia, after it lifted its export ban on these birds earlier this week.  > ""I stopped buying chicken because it was more expensive. But since they started selling fresh Malaysian chickens again, I'm buying chicken today for a special occasion. If not I would have gone for pork instead,"" Ms Rose said.  > Almost 4½ months after Malaysia banned the export due to a domestic shortage, the first batch of live Malaysian broiler chickens crossed the Causeway on Thursday morning, with supermarkets receiving the first batch of these chickens later on Thursday afternoon.  > Broiler chickens are raised specifically for meat production and bred for optimal health and size. This is the most common type found in supermarkets and makes up the biggest portion of Singapore's chicken imports from Malaysia. They are typically exported to Singapore at around 40 days old.  > People have flocked to the wet markets and mini marts in the heartlands on Friday to buy fresh entire chickens or chicken parts from Singapore's northern neighbour, despite the 15 to 35 per cent increase in prices, as compared to that before Malaysia's ban in June, which stemmed from domestic shortage of chickens.  > The Straits Times observed healthy crowds at poultry stalls in wet markets in Bedok, Ghim Moh, Serangoon and Toa Payoh, with hawkers expecting to sell out their supply of fresh chickens.  > Some, like 48-year-old domestic helper Rowena Valdez, said fresh chickens - while more expensive than before - were still better value for money than kampung ones.  > ""During the ban, we switched to kampung chicken, but they are usually smaller, have less meat and are more expensive than fresh chicken,"" said Ms Valdez, who bought an entire chicken at the Toa Payoh Lorong 1 market.  > ""A whole fresh chicken now costs around $16, but they are bigger and more worth it.""  > In contrast, a kampung chicken, which is typically smaller, would cost about $12.  > Mr Vincent Liow, the co-owner of Ken & Vin Fresh Poultry at Ghim Moh Road Market and Food Centre said that most of his fresh chicken stock was already running out when ST visited at 8am, owing to pre-orders from his customers.  > The 47-year-old said: ""The birds used to cost me around $4 per kg but now it's close to $7 so I've had to raise my price from $6 per kg to $8. But most of the fresh chicken and its parts are already gone.""  --- 1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"
